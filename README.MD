#### Go Practice

---

This is a repository for Learning GO. I'm going to be following 2 books:

SamsTeachYourself (Because I love how he sections and explains things quickly)
https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/go-in-24/9780134771922/

And Oreilly's book (Since it focuses a lot on how to be a GO developer specifically):
https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/


This (probably) won't lead to a project. But maybe just practice folders for me to make sure I am staying on track. Using Github to make sure I can move this base between my computers, and keep track of my progress. Also going to use this as a side project, so I can pick up this skill while I work on my Resume website, and who knows this might help that as well due to the Nature of go :)
